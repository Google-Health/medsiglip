# MedSigLIP Notebooks

*   [Quick start with Hugging Face](quick_start_with_hugging_face.ipynb) -
    Example of encoding a medical image into an embedding vector by running the
    model locally from Hugging Face.

*   [Quick start with Model Garden](quick_start_with_model_garden.ipynb) -
    Example of serving the model on
    [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/overview)
    and using Vertex AI APIs to encode medical images and text to embeddings in
    online or batch workflows.

*   [Fine-tune with Hugging Face](fine_tune_with_hugging_face.ipynb) - Example
    of fine-tuning the model for contrastive image-text learning using Hugging
    Face libraries.

*   [Fine-tune for image classification](fine_tune_for_image_classification.ipynb) - Example
    of fine-tuning the vision encoder for multi-label image classification using
    Hugging Face libraries.

*   [Train a data efficient classifier](train_data_efficient_classifier.ipynb) -
    Example of using the generated image embeddings to train a custom classifier
    with less data and compute.
