        "\n",
        "* **Online predictions** are synchronous requests that are made to the endpoint deployed from Model Garden and are served with low latency. Online predictions are useful if the embeddings are being used in production. The cost for online prediction is based on the time a virtual machine spends waiting in an active state (an endpoint with a deployed model) to handle prediction requests.\n",

They are made directly to an uploaded model and do not use an endpoint deployed from Model Garden. Batch predictions are useful if you want to generate embeddings for a large number of inputs for use in training and don't require low latency. The cost for batch prediction is based on the time a virtual machine spends running your prediction job.\n",
